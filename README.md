Swahili is spoken by 100-150 million people across East Africa. In Tanzania, it is one of two national languages (the other is English) and it is the official language of instruction in all schools. News in Swahili is an important part of the media sphere in Tanzania.

News contributes to education, technology, and the economic growth of a country, and news in local languages plays an important cultural role in many African countries. In the modern age, African languages in news and other spheres are at risk of being lost as English becomes the dominant language in online spaces.

The objective of this hackathon is to develop a multi-class classification model to classify news content according to their specific categories specified, with a catch: you can only use ChatGPT to generate your models. Prompt engineering is an important skill that many companies are looking for - show off your prompt engineering chops by taking part in this challenge!
